# Big Picture

Each week I'll ask you to write a short, reflection that addresses some element of our course work. Reflective writing takes practice and these short, weekly pieces offer you the opportunity to that.

Specifically, these reflections help you work toward course outcome 6 -- *Reflect on how individuals' (i.e. learners and instructor) positional identities in the learning spaces shape an understanding of the field of study* -- and overtime develop the reflective essay project for the course.

Additionally, I'm also asking you to practice synthesizing information from sources outside your experiences which supports outcome 4 -- *Apply research processes and use source materials based on need, circumstance, and type of inquiry to provide sound, evidentiary support for projects*. While much of the work of technical writers is in genres outside of more traditional academic writing, the skill and practice of synthesizing information and citing sources remains relavant in many technical communication contexts.

# Rubric/ Assessment

Complete short reflections will:

+ be 200 - 500 words
+ practice citing the course reading for the week. (If there are multiple texts, cite at least one).
+ practice using a citation style. You can use MLA or APA or another style. I recommend choosing the style most common to your major/field of study. 

For help with citation styles, see the Writing Center's Canvas Page or a resource like Purdue OWL.

# This week...


# Week 1

So let's start with the idea of "positional identities." Generally, when we talk about positionality we're talking about where one is located -- by themselves and others -- within their social identities (gender, race, class, ethnicity, ability, geographical location, amongst other potential factors). Complex combinations of these social identities shape how we see and engage the world, including how we see and engage with fields of study and professional processes like technical communication.

+ *How would you, at this point, describe your positional identities? Where do you locate yourself within your social identities? Do you have a sense of where others' locate or might locate/position you?*

Again, our social identities put us in relation/position to the world, impacting how we understand, engage and experience things.

+ * Given your sense of your social identities, how do you see yourself in relation to the field of technical communication? What are your beliefs about this topic (tech comm)? Any history or personal interaction with it? What hopes do have for engaging with it? How do you see it fitting into your daily life? Future studies? Career path?*


# Week 2

We've started the initial phase of our sewing and coding project work. This week I'd like you to capture/record some thoughts in the early stages of these projects. Some questions that might guide your reflection this week:

+ Revisit what you wrote about your *positional idendities*. How does your sense of self come into play as you think about and begin to engage the work of learning to sew and code? 
+ What do you anticipate or think one might learn about technical writing by learning through the projects we will work on this quarter?
+ How confident do you feel in your ability to successfully complete our projects this quarter? How, at this point, do you define *success* in this context?

I addition to considering the questions above, I'd like you to also read these three pieces this week. They each take up the juxtaposition of coding and sewing (or programming and crafting), and are themselves examples of reflective writing:

+ Fenanda Foertter's ["Doing women's work: Sewing my life together"](https://foertter.com/2019/06/23/doing-womens-work-sewing-my-life-together/)
+ Anna Ossowski's ["What does cross stitch have to do with programming? More than you think."](https://opensource.com/article/17/11/traditional-arts-crafts-code-programming) 
+ 

Remember, one of the the things we want to practice in your weekly reflections is integrating/synthesizing the ideas of others with our own.
