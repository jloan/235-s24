# Sewing Tool List

+ Small Ironing Board OR ironing wool
+ Iron
+ Needles (rather than quilting needles, I'd go with embroidery needles. They are a bit longer and have a bigger eye. You could also buy a pack of misc. needles which has a variety.)
+ Pin cushion
+ Pins 
+ Thread (all-purpose thread is great). A variety of colors is great. 4-5 spools min.
+ Scissors. min. 5
+ Rotary cutter
+ Cutting mat (like the self-healing craft mat)
+ Acrylic ruler(s) (A long one is helpful, but a variety is cool, too)
+ Other rulers (I bought some cheap wood rulers so students could mark sewing lines on their fabric)
+ Pencils

# Optional: 

+ Embroidery floss. This is a thicker thread, and you can sew with all of it or just a couple strands of it, but it is especially vibrant and great for sewing designs on fabric, rather than sewing things together.
+ Chalk or chalk pencil or fabric erasable pen. Something to draw on fabric that can be removed/washed out.
+ Fabric paint or markers so students could add designs on fabric.
+ Needle minder (usually a felt book or something to store the needles after they come out of the original packaging; they get lost in the pin cushion. Sometimes people use a magnet)
+ A magnetâ€”someone (AKA me) dropped a bunch of pins and I wished we had a magnet.
