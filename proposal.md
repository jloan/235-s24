# Big Picture

One of the first genres we'll work with is the proposal. Generaly a proposal is a document that tries to convince the reader/audience to approve the proposed project or implement the proposed plan. 

We are going to use the proposal to articulate our understadning, ideas, and plans for our community knowledge website project. My role is this will be less to strictly "approve" or "reject" the proposal, but to offer feedback and guidance on the project idea.

In drafting these proposal we'll also be able to do some inituial practice with [document design](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-esc-communicationforprofessionals/chapter/1148/) and using important text elements like headings. 

For more on the proposal genre, see [this chapter](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/chapter/proposals/) from a Tech Writing OER.

Also, here's [an example of a proposal I wrote](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MzfAyU0-Jka0By43Pkpb4JVMvbvH-ZR_/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108284175599871369492&rtpof=true&sd=true) for a project a few years ago here at Pierce. Note: Your proposal does not need to look like mine, but it will give you a sense of some of the things proposal tend to do and an example of the use of headings and other docuemnt design elements. 

# Your Proposal (Early Iteration)

Draft an initial proposal for your Community Website Project that does the following:

+ Summarizes project in 2 - 3 sentence
+ Defines the problem/need of the community that will be the intended audience of your site. Who has the need/problem? What is the need/probelm? Why is it important to solve this need/problem?
+ Describe one or more ideas for the technical knowledge resource(s) that your site will provide your community. What knowledge will your project contribute to your community in response to the problem/need? How will the technical knowledge resource(s) you create address the need.problem you've identified and are responding to?
+ Outlines next steps. What actions/activities will you need to engage in to succesfully complete the project? For example, what research might you need to do? 

# Assessment

A complete initial proposal will:

+ Address the areas outlined above -- summarize project, define a need, describe the resources/knowledge intervention, and outline next steps.
+ use headings in document design

Optional:

+ include images
+ include a bulleted/numbered list
