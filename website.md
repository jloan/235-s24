# Big Picture

The purpose of this web building project is to offer you a process for meeting these course learning outcomes:

1.	**Create both individual and collaborative projects that demonstrate knowledge of rhetorical situations and genre in the context of technical communication.**
2.	**Experiment with and troubleshoot processes of working with new media in rhetorical situations that call for the use of digital communication.**
3.	**Evaluate style, form, convention, and information design, both in one's own work and the work of others.**
4.	**Apply research processes and use source materials based on need, circumstance, and type of inquiry to provide sound, evidentiary support for projects.**
5.	**Implement strategies for addressing issues of ethics, equity, and accessibility in the context of technical writing projects.**
6.	Reflect on how individuals' (i.e. learners and instructor) positional identities in the learning spaces shape an understanding of the field of study.


That's almost all of them, five of six. Arguably this project will also help you meet outcome 6 - *Reflect on how individuals' (i.e. learners and instructor) positional identities in the learning spaces shape an understanding of the field of study.* -- as you will be reflecting on your project work throughout the quarter. But we have a another project that more fully takes that outcome on, so we'll just call it 5 of 6. 

# The Project

Use valid HTML and CSS to create a simple website about yourself that also shares with your audience some community technical knowledge that you helped produce. Community technical knowledge may relate to your studies, but it could also intersect with a hobby, club, cultural association, occupation, neighbourhood, volunteer job, or union, for instance. Your site can be a single page, and it may include a variety of media (text, audio, images, and/or video). It should not contain any advertisements, and it should not be a blog or replicate the 'profile' format of social media. 

I'll be creating a site along side you, so I encourage you to take cues from my work to inform your own. I'll ask you to write a brief proposal for your site and we'll workshop ideas as a class. We will also deidicate one of our weekly in-person class sessons to doing hand-on work with this project. Given our time constraints you most likely will not be able to complete all the work for this project in class, but our classs time will offer us substantive time to cooperatively learn the skills of HTML/CSS and develop our projects. 

We'll use [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) as a starting point for building these sites. You will be able to publish your site for free using Glitch, but I will also show you how to make a site the functions locally without publishing on the web. 

# Timeline

+ Week 3 -- Project Proposal due
+ Week 5 -- Initial draft of site due
+ Week 10 -- Revised draft of site due

# Resources

+ Text Editor -- [Notepad++ (PC)](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [BBEdit (Mac)](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) or [Sublime Text (Mac)](https://www.sublimetext.com/download). To write HTML and CSS you will mostly likely at somepoint need a text editor. While our computers come with a basic one, more robust useful versions are available for free. 
+ [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) -- Glitch is a platform that supports buulding things for the web, including simple websites. We'll use this as a jumping off point for building our sites, and you will also have the option of hosting your site at Glitch for free. 
+ Jackie Liou's ["Build an Underconstruction Mini Site."](https://www.zinesbyjackie.com/activities/build-an-under-construction-page) -- A great intro to the basics of HTML and CSS. We'll build these minisites as one of the initial steps in the project.
+ [W3Schools Tutotials](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) -- A collection of tutorials for learning HTML and CSS (and other code things). You are encouraged to consult any number of technical communication resources to help you build your project, but I've found W3Schools a good starting point. 

# Project Rubric/Assessment

 + main content (the technical knowledge you contribute/develop/share)
 + an about section
 + a footer
 + at least one image
 + at least one external link
 + valid markup (HTML5) - use https://validator.w3.org/
 + 1500 - 2500 words 

Optional:
