# Big Picture

The purpose of this web building project is to offer you a process for meeting these course learning outcomes (in bold):

1.	**Create both individual and collaborative projects that demonstrate knowledge of rhetorical situations and genre in the context of technical communication.**
2.	Experiment with and troubleshoot processes of working with new media in rhetorical situations that call for the use of digital communication.**
3.	Evaluate style, form, convention, and information design, both in one's own work and the work of others.**
4.	**Apply research processes and use source materials based on need, circumstance, and type of inquiry to provide sound, evidentiary support for projects.**
5.	Implement strategies for addressing issues of ethics, equity, and accessibility in the context of technical writing projects.
6.	**Reflect on how individuals' (i.e. learners and instructor) positional identities in the learning spaces shape an understanding of the field of study.**

This project is the space where outcome 6 really gets forgrounded

I recommend brief and focused content. Avoid scope creep, especially given the time constraints. You might, for instance, revise and/or reformat work youâ€™ve done in the past and then include it alongside a short description of yourself and/or your interests. Feel free to run ideas by me and your peers as you proceed, and please ensure you give credit to anyone who contributed to your site or community knowledge. You are not required to publish Site 1 online; however, in Module 5, I will show you how to publish it with and without a passcode."
