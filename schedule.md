This schedule is a sketch. Things may, and probably will, change once we start the work. 

# Basic Structure of a Week

## Two in-person class sessions

Focus: Hands-on, cooperative work. 

*Tuesdays*: Sewing focused. We'll learn to sew together.

*Thursdays*: Code focused. We'll learn HTML and CSS together. 

## Outside of class

Our work outside of class will include:

+ Reading and responding to texts. (This is how we'll engage in thinking about the things and ideas that make up technical writing)
+ Skills practice. You'll need time outside of class to continue to practice the things -- sewing/coding -- we start practicing in class.
+ Project work. You'll need time outside of class to work on course projects -- our sewing project, your community resource website, and your reflective piece on learning and communicating (new) technical skills. 

## A note on deadlines

When we have deadlines, they will typically be on Mondays. A couple of reasons here. Once a week dealines -- rather than multiple deadlines throughout the week -- allow for some routine and flexiility. Count on things being due Mondays. And all of our weeks are probably different schedule wise. Having one dealine allows for you to hopefully work within your schedule. For example, if you know you never have time over the weekend to work on things -- you can prioritize getting stuf done by Friday or Monday. And if weekends are you est time to work, you have until Monday to work on what ever is happening that week. 

# Week 1 -- April 1 - 5

+ Introductions to each other, technical writing and the course.
+ *Tuesday*: We'll talk about the class, logictics, and do some socializing.
+ *Thursday*: Code work -- we'll set the stage for our coding work. Go over Community Knowledge Website Project, intro to tools we'll be using for code work (text editors, Glitch, tutorial resources, etc.)

## DUE WEEK 2: 

+ Read/Respond: Introduction to Solving Problems in Tech Comm
+ Read/Respond: Jackie Liu's Build a Website Zine and 
+ Write: Short Refletion #1

## Jump Start/Work Ahead

When possible I'll offer a chance to get started on something that isn't necessarily due on Monday, but that if you have the time or inkling you might want to get a jump on. 

+ Practice: Get started with HTML and CSS. Complete Jackie Lio's "Build an Underconstruction Mini Site" tutorial and work though the opening sections of W3schools HTML Tutorial. What might learning HTML/CSS teach us about technical communication? 

# Week 2 -- April 8 - 12

## Rhetorical Theory and Tech Writing

+ *Tuesday*: Sewing Workshop/Practice. Intros and Set-up. A key question for us this quarter: *What might learning to sew/quilt teach us about technical communictaion?*

+ *Thursday*: Coding Workshop/Practice. Together we'll work through Jackie Liu's "Build an Underconstruction Mini Site" tutorial. 


## DUE MONDAY of WEEK 3: 

+ Read/Respond: Porter's "How Can Rhetoric Theory Inform the Practice of Technical Communication?"
