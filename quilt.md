# Big Picture

The purpose of this quilt making project is to offer you a process for meeting these course learning outcomes (in bold):

1.	**Create both individual and collaborative projects that demonstrate knowledge of rhetorical situations and genre in the context of technical communication.**
2.	Experiment with and troubleshoot processes of working with new media in rhetorical situations that call for the use of digital communication.
3.	**Evaluate style, form, convention, and information design, both in one's own work and the work of others.**
4.	**Apply research processes and use source materials based on need, circumstance, and type of inquiry to provide sound, evidentiary support for projects.**
5.	**Implement strategies for addressing issues of ethics, equity, and accessibility in the context of technical writing projects.**
6.	Reflect on how individuals' (i.e. learners and instructor) positional identities in the learning spaces shape an understanding of the field of study.

Again, that's almost all of them, four of six. 

Again, Arguably this project will also help you meet outcome 6 - *Reflect on how individuals' (i.e. learners and instructor) positional identities in the learning spaces shape an understanding of the field of study.* -- but like I said, we have a another project that more fully takes that outcome on. 

Also -- I think I can make the case the this project also helps you meet outcome 2 -- *Experiment with and troubleshoot processes of working with new media in rhetorical situations that call for the use of digital communication.* -- because you will be working with new media (reading websites, watching video tutorials, etc) in the process of making your quilt. In other words you;ll be trouble shooting processes of working with new media *as a user* and not so much as a writer. Also -- one of the points of the quilt project is that we'll be working with *old media* like needles, thread and fabric...

Anyway, my guess is you didn;t think you;d be sewing in a tech writing class, but trust me -- it will help us get to learning outcomes. 

# The Project

Explore the challenges of learning a technical skill by identifying, evlauating and using available technical communication resources (websites, zines, videos, etc.) to sew a 9 Patch Mini Quilt. 

Visually document your learning/sewing process using multiple media (images, words, etc.)

I'll be creating a Quilt along side you, and I have also never made one, so we'll be learning together.  

While learning some of the basics of sewing, we'll do some lo-fi prototyping and design work for the quilts we'll make. We will also deidicate one of our weekly in-person class sessons to doing hand-on work with this project. Given our time constraints you most likely will not be able to complete all the work for this project in class, but our classs time will offer us substantive time to cooperatively learn some sewing skills and troubleshot the processes of working with these *old media*. 

We'll use resources like [American Pathwork and Quilting](https://www.allpeoplequilt.com/) and Amy Smart's ["Nine Patch Mini Quilt Tutorial"](https://www.diaryofaquilter.com/nine-patch-mini-quilt-tutorial/) as starting points for making our quilt projects. There are a variatey of other technical resources we might use, and much of our work in this project will be to explore and evaluate these various options. 


# Timeline

+ Week 5 -- Have sewn an initial 9 Patch quilt square. Submit process documentation. 
+ Week 10 -- Mini-quilt due

# Resources

+ I have a supply kit of sewing tools and materials that I will make available to the class. You are free to supplement this class tool kit with materials of your own, but my intention is not for you to necessarily buy anything. 
+ Various technical resources like like [American Pathwork and Quilting](https://www.allpeoplequilt.com/) and Amy Smart's ["Nine Patch Mini Quilt Tutorial"](https://www.diaryofaquilter.com/nine-patch-mini-quilt-tutorial/). 


# Project Rubric/Assessment

Complete quilt project will contain: 

+ one nine pathch square
+ multiple colors of fabric
+ Batting
+ Binding
+ a collection of process documentation (images, videos, words, drawings, etc.)

Optional: 

+ more than one nine patch square. 

# On mistakes, imperfections, and failure 

Finally, let me just say that this project is assigned in the spirit of *generative* or *productive* faliure. That's not to say that I don't think each and every one of us isn't capable of making a mini quilt. But I think it's fair to say that the process of trying to make one -- especially if you have no experience or technical skill in this area -- will inevitable involve many mistakes, imperfactions, and faliures. 

You are not being assessed on the perfection or "professional look" of your quilt. Our assessment is rooted in your engagement of the process of learing a new technical skill, of your willingness to put yourself in the position of *the user* and *audience* of technical communication.
